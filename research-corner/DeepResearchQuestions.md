# Five Crucial Questions for a Deep Research LLM

Below are five carefully formulated questions designed to push a large language model (LLM) toward comprehensive, high-level research insights when it processes a body of 10–15 diverse sources. These questions help ensure the model delivers a rigorous, multi-dimensional research report that would otherwise demand significant time and expense.

1. **Context & Foundations**  
   - *“Given the collected sources, what are the foundational theories, prior findings, and essential background concepts that form the basis of this research topic—and how do they interrelate?”*  
   This question directs the LLM to aggregate crucial foundational details, ensuring it provides a well-grounded starting point and clarifies interconnections among the fundamental concepts across all sources.

2. **Comparative Analysis & Contrasting Views**  
   - *“Which core arguments or hypotheses from these sources differ or contrast most strongly, and on what evidence do they rest? Are there any notable points of consensus or ongoing debate among them?”*  
   By prompting the LLM to compare sources directly, we get a structured report of conflicting or converging viewpoints, backed by explicit references to the data or studies supporting each claim.

3. **Methodology & Data Quality**  
   - *“What research methods, experimental designs, or data-collection techniques do the sources employ, and which methodological strengths, weaknesses, or biases could significantly affect their conclusions?”*  
   This ensures the LLM examines the reliability and validity of each source’s approach, helping us discern how methodological differences might impact their findings or how biases could shape conclusions.

4. **Emerging Patterns & Synthesis**  
   - *“Looking across all studies, which notable patterns, trends, or thematic clusters emerge, and how can they be synthesized into a cohesive framework that advances our understanding of the topic?”*  
   This question asks the LLM to integrate findings into a logical whole—uncovering patterns that might not be obvious from a simple reading of individual sources and suggesting how they collectively build a more robust perspective.

5. **Gaps, Future Directions & Practical Implications**  
   - *“Based on the identified gaps or unresolved questions in the current body of research, what are the priority areas for future investigation or practical application, and how might these shape next-generation studies or industry solutions?”*  
   Here, the LLM is directed to highlight what remains unknown or underexplored. It also encourages a forward-looking perspective, suggesting potential avenues for future work and real-world impact.
