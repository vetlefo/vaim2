# Model Training Setup and Roadmap

This document outlines the additional requirements and steps needed to start training our own UI-to-code generation model as soon as possible. It complements the existing research and training requirements documentation.

## 1. Data Requirements and Preparation
- **Dataset Collection**: Aggregate a diverse set of UI images paired with corresponding code examples. Leverage public datasets (e.g., RICO, ReDraw) and augment with synthetic data to cover a wide range of UI designs and edge cases.
- **Data Annotation**: Ensure consistent labeling of UI components, properties, and corresponding code. Include complex and nested UI examples to improve model generalization.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and standardize both image and code data. This includes image normalization, resizing, and ensuring code formatting consistency (using tools like Prettier or ESLint).

## 2. Model Architecture and Training Strategy
- **Base Model Selection**: Choose a pre-trained code generation model (e.g., Code Llama, StarCoder, or a GPT-based model) to fine-tune for UI-to-code tasks.
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Plan for a two-stage or integrated multi-modal architecture that combines vision (for UI detection and OCR) with language (for prompt-to-code generation).
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilize transfer learning to reduce training time and computational cost by fine-tuning an existing model rather than training from scratch.

## 3. Training Infrastructure
- **Compute Resources**: Secure necessary GPU resources (cloud-based or on-premise) and consider leveraging cloud credits from providers such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- **Frameworks and Tools**: Implement training using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Integrate experiment tracking tools (e.g., Weights & Biases, MLflow) for monitoring training progress.
- **Reproducibility**: Containerize the training environment with Docker or Conda to ensure consistent reproducibility across different setups.

## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning and Validation
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Establish a systematic approach for tuning key parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and model-specific configurations.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Define metrics for code correctness, syntactic validity, and functional performance. Incorporate automated testing (linting, compilation tests, snapshot testing) into the validation process.
- **Iterative Training**: Set up iterative training cycles with regular validation checkpoints to continuously refine model performance.

## 5. Deployment and Integration
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Develop a robust pipeline to deploy the trained model into the existing UI-to-code system.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless integration with the current code generation pipeline by conducting end-to-end tests using real UI examples.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Implement mechanisms for gathering user feedback on generated code to drive continuous improvement and retraining strategies.

## 6. Additional Considerations
- **Security and Privacy**: Anonymize sensitive data in training datasets and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Licensing and Legal Compliance**: Verify that all data sources and model usage adhere to appropriate licenses and legal standards.
- **Cost Management**: Monitor training and inference costs carefully, and explore cost optimization strategies (e.g., mixed precision training, efficient batching).
- **Documentation and Updates**: Regularly update this roadmap as new insights are gained and the training process evolves.

This roadmap serves as a comprehensive starting point for launching our model training initiative and should be iteratively refined as we progress.
