# Research Corner

This directory serves as a dedicated environment for exploring AI/ML capabilities, prompt engineering, and UI generation research. It provides a structured foundation for experimenting with various AI models, prompt engineering techniques, and automated UI development approaches.

## Purpose

- Provide an environment for AI/ML research and development
- Enable experimentation with prompt engineering and optimization
- Test integration with various AI models and providers
- Explore UI generation and automation patterns
- Serve as a proving ground for AI-powered development concepts

## Structure

### Prompt Lab (`prompt-lab/`)
A comprehensive environment for prompt engineering and testing:
- Dataset management and generation
- Evaluation frameworks
- Project management interfaces
- Real-time collaboration features

### AI Integration
- `src/ai/deepseek.service.ts`: DeepSeek AI integration service
- `AI_UI_Code_Analysis.md`: Research on AI-powered UI generation
- `model_training_setup.md`: ML model training configuration
- `training_requirements.md`: Training infrastructure requirements

### Research Documentation
- Various research findings and experiments in AI/UI generation
- Implementation patterns and best practices
- Performance analysis and benchmarks

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new research branch
2. Implement AI/ML features or prompt engineering experiments
3. Test using the prompt-lab environment
4. Document findings and performance metrics
5. Optionally integrate with main services

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the prompt lab
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Contributing

When adding new experiments:

1. Document the approach and methodology
2. Provide clear examples and use cases
3. Include performance metrics where applicable
4. Consider production implications
5. Maintain proper isolation from core services

## Current Focus Areas

- Prompt Engineering Optimization
- AI-Powered UI Generation
- Model Integration and Testing
- Training Data Management
- Evaluation Frameworks
