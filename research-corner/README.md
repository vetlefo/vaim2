# Research Corner

This directory serves as a dedicated sandbox environment for exploring quantum computing and high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities within our system. It provides a structured foundation for experimenting with quantum-inspired algorithms, post-quantum cryptography, and advanced computational techniques without impacting our production services.

## Purpose

- Provide an isolated environment for quantum and HPC research and development
- Enable experimentation with quantum-inspired optimization algorithms
- Test integration of post-quantum cryptographic libraries
- Explore HPC orchestration and scaling patterns
- Serve as a proving ground for advanced computational concepts

## Structure

- `quantum-experiments.service.ts`: Core service for quantum-inspired experiments
- `Dockerfile.research`: Containerization setup for HPC/quantum environment
- Supporting configuration and utility files

## Future Integrations

This corner is designed to accommodate various quantum and HPC libraries such as:

- Post-quantum cryptography libraries (e.g., liboqs)
- Quantum-inspired optimization frameworks
- HPC orchestration tools
- Quantum simulation libraries

## Environment Configuration

The service supports the following environment variables:

```env
POST_QUANTUM_EXPERIMENT=true  # Enable post-quantum features
QUANTUM_SIMULATOR_MODE=basic  # Simulation complexity level
HPC_CLUSTER_ENDPOINT=        # Optional HPC cluster connection
```

## Integration Guidelines

While this corner is isolated from production code, it's designed to be easily integrated when needed:

1. Services can import quantum-inspired algorithms as modules
2. Post-quantum cryptography can be enabled via feature flags
3. HPC capabilities can be accessed through well-defined interfaces

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new experiment branch
2. Implement quantum-inspired or HPC features
3. Test in isolation using provided containers
4. Document findings and performance metrics
5. Optionally integrate with main services

## Getting Started

```bash
# Build the research environment
docker build -f Dockerfile.research -t quantum-research .

# Run the quantum experiments service
docker run -e POST_QUANTUM_EXPERIMENT=true quantum-research
```

## Security Considerations

- All quantum-inspired features are disabled by default
- Post-quantum cryptography experiments are isolated
- HPC resources are accessed through secure channels
- Separate containerization prevents production impact

## Contributing

When adding new experiments:

1. Document the theoretical background
2. Provide clear integration patterns
3. Include performance benchmarks
4. Consider production implications
5. Maintain isolation from core services

This research corner is part of our long-term strategy for quantum readiness and HPC integration. For more details, see our [quantum readiness documentation](../phases/quantum-readiness.md).
