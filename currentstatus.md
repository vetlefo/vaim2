   - As data grows, ensuring minimal latency for graph queries and LLM requests is crucial.  
   - Potential switch to distributed Neo4j or additional read replicas.

2. **Security & Compliance**  
   - Ongoing need to refine OAuth2 flows, zero-trust architecture, and post-quantum cryptographic measures (in HPC or extended phases).

3. **Complex Orchestration**  
   - Multiple dependencies (Neo4j, Kafka, Redis, HPC stubs) can complicate environment setup.  
   - Future Kubernetes-based deployments and ephemeral HPC resource usage will require robust CI/CD pipelines.

4. **Quantum/HPC Integration**  
   - Research Corner is promising but might require specialized infrastructure for real HPC or quantum tasks.  
   - The system remains ready for these expansions whenever they become a priority.
