# ThoughtGraph Implementation

## Overview

The ThoughtGraph system implements the specifications from [thought-graph.md](../thought-graph.md), providing a robust graph-based storage and analytics system for LLM chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Core Components

### 1. Neo4j Integration
```typescript
// Cypher queries for graph operations
- CREATE_THOUGHT
- CREATE_REVISION
- CREATE_BRANCH
- GET_THOUGHT_CHAIN
- GET_RELATED_THOUGHTS
```

### 2. ThoughtGraph Service
```typescript
interface ThoughtNode {
  id: number;
  content: string;
  type: 'insight' | 'question' | 'evidence' | 'conclusion';
  status: 'active' | 'revised' | 'deprecated';
  metadata: {
    llmUsage?: any;
    hpcInfo?: any;
    created: string;
    modified: string;
  };
}
```

### 3. Monitoring Integration
- Prometheus metrics for graph operations
- Audit logging for all mutations
- Performance tracking

## Implementation Details

### 1. Graph Storage
- Neo4j as primary storage
- Graph Data Science library for analytics
- Real-time operation tracking

### 2. Service Architecture
```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [MonitoringModule, Neo4jModule],
  providers: [ThoughtGraphService],
  exports: [ThoughtGraphService],
})
```

### 3. Key Operations
1. Thought Creation
   - Atomic operations
   - Audit logging
   - Performance metrics

2. Revisions & Branching
   - Maintains thought history
   - Tracks relationships
   - Supports parallel exploration

3. Analytics
   - Community detection
   - Centrality measures
   - Path analysis

## Security Controls

Implements Phase 3 requirements:
- Authentication tracking
- Operation auditing
- Data access controls
- Token validation

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests
   - Core graph operations
   - Data validation
   - Error handling

2. Integration Tests
   - Neo4j operations
   - Monitoring integration
   - Analytics workflows

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics
1. Graph Operations
   - Creation rate
   - Revision frequency
   - Branch patterns
   
2. Performance
   - Query latency
   - Memory usage
   - Cache hit rates

3. Security
   - Auth events
   - Access patterns
   - Token operations
