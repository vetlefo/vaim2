# Data Pipeline Implementation

## Overview
The data pipeline implementation provides automated analytics processing, data retention management, and monitoring capabilities for the graph analytics service.

## Components

### Pipeline Service
- Manages scheduled analytics jobs
- Handles data retention policies
- Integrates with monitoring system
- Configurable through environment variables

### Monitoring Service
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Tracks job durations and failures
- Monitors data retention operations
- Exposes metrics endpoint for collection

### Data Retention
- Configurable retention period (default: 90 days)
- Automated cleanup of old data
- Data archival capabilities
- Transaction-safe deletion process

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Monitoring Configuration
ENABLE_METRICS=true
METRICS_PORT=9464

# Data Retention Configuration
DATA_RETENTION_DAYS=90
DATA_RETENTION_ARCHIVE_PATH=/data/archives
DATA_RETENTION_SCHEDULE=0 0 3 * * * # Run at 3 AM daily

# Pipeline Configuration
PIPELINE_DAILY_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
PIPELINE_WEEKLY_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
PIPELINE_DAILY_ANALYTICS_TIME=0 0 0 * * * # Run at midnight
PIPELINE_WEEKLY_ANALYTICS_TIME=0 0 0 * * 0 # Run at midnight on Sundays
```

## Scheduled Jobs

### Daily Analytics
- PageRank computation
- Community detection
- Data retention enforcement
- Runs at configured time (default: midnight)

### Weekly Analytics
- Node similarity analysis
- Graph statistics computation
- Runs at configured time (default: midnight on Sundays)

## Monitoring Metrics

### Job Metrics
- `graph_analytics_job_duration_seconds`: Histogram of analytics job duration
- `graph_analytics_job_failures_total`: Counter of failed analytics jobs

### Data Retention Metrics
- `graph_data_retention_deletions_total`: Counter of deleted nodes/relationships

## Error Handling
- Failed jobs are logged and tracked in Prometheus
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed operations
- Alert configuration available through Prometheus

## Performance Monitoring
The service currently tracks the following metrics:

### Standard Metrics
- Job execution times and failures
- Data retention operations
- Memory and CPU usage
- Query response times
- Cache hit rates

### Graph-Specific Metrics
- Node/relationship creation rates
- Graph algorithm performance
- Query pattern statistics
- Index utilization

All metrics are exposed via Prometheus endpoint and can be visualized through Grafana dashboards.

## Future Enhancements

### HPC Integration Status
While the service is designed with scalability in mind, HPC integration is currently in the planning phase. Future releases will introduce:
- Distributed graph processing
- GPU acceleration for specific algorithms
- Parallel computation capabilities

### Machine Learning Pipeline
Advanced ML integration is planned but not yet implemented. Future features will include:
- Graph embedding generation
- ML-based anomaly detection
- Predictive analytics
These capabilities are part of the roadmap but are not currently available in the main codebase.

## Best Practices
1. Monitor the metrics endpoint for job performance
2. Adjust retention period based on data growth
3. Configure archive path with sufficient storage
4. Review job schedules to minimize impact on system performance
5. Use provided monitoring dashboards for performance tracking
6. Regularly review algorithm performance metrics

## Security Considerations
- Metrics endpoint requires authentication
- Archived data is encrypted
- Access to retention operations is restricted
- Audit logging of all retention activities
