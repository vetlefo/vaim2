# Phase 3: Data Integration Layer

## Architecture & Stack

- **Data Integration Components**
  - Data ingestion pipeline
  - Data transformation services
  - Data storage integration
- **Technology Choices**
  - Apache Kafka for event streaming
  - Apache Spark for data processing
  - Data warehouse integration (Snowflake/BigQuery)

## Development & Deployment

- **Pipeline Implementation**
  - Real-time data ingestion
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Data quality monitoring
- **Integration Strategy**
  - API-based data access
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Data versioning and lineage

## DevOps & Environment Setup

- **Data Pipeline Configuration**
  - Environment-specific data sources
  - Pipeline monitoring and alerting
  - Data retention policies
- **Security**
  - Data encryption in transit and at rest
  - Access control mechanisms
    - OAuth2 integration for secure third-party authentication
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Fine-grained permissions for data access
  - Audit logging
    - Authentication events
    - Data access tracking
    - System changes
  - Token management
    - JWT token lifecycle
    - Refresh token rotation
    - Token blacklisting
  - Provider integration
    - Multiple OAuth2 provider support
    - Provider-specific security configurations
    - User profile mapping and validation

## Key Considerations

- Data consistency and integrity
- Scalability of data processing
- Real-time vs batch processing tradeoffs
- Data governance and compliance
