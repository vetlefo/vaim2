# Phase 2: Core Service Implementation

## Architecture & Stack

- **Service Components**
  - Authentication service
  - Data processing pipeline
  - API gateway
- **Technology Choices**
  - Node.js/NestJS for API services
  - Python for data processing
  - GraphQL for API gateway

## Development & Deployment

- **Service Implementation**
  - Authentication service with OAuth2
  - Data processing pipeline with ETL capabilities
  - API gateway for service orchestration
- **Testing Strategy**
  - Unit tests for each service
  - Integration tests for service interactions

## DevOps & Environment Setup

- **Service Configuration**
  - Centralized configuration management
  - Environment-specific service configurations
- **Monitoring**
  - Service health monitoring
  - Performance metrics collection

## Key Considerations

- Security implementation for authentication
- Data validation and sanitization
- Service discovery and load balancing
- API versioning strategy
