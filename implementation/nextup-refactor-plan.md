## Initial Analysis
Current Code Structure:

nextup.md is a Markdown file describing the streaming response system’s challenges, requirements, and an action plan.
Sections include:
Current Challenges
Solution Requirements
Reasoning Model Prompt
Architectural Considerations
Action Plan
Acceptance Criteria
Identified Modules / Potential Separation Points:

The text references multiple streaming concerns: chunk assembly, schema validation, SSE/CORS setup, backpressure, monitoring.
For code maintenance, these distinct subtopics could be separated into smaller modules if implemented in code. However, we are dealing with documentation, so no direct code modules are present.
We only add clarifications to ensure a “bulletproof approach,” without changing or removing any original logic.
Proposed Changes
Add Buffering Approach

Clarify how partial JSON objects can be handled by an internal buffer.
Suggest advanced handling with chunk boundary detection to avoid incomplete objects.
Emphasize Rolling Schema Versions

Add a mention of a schema registry to handle multiple schema versions for partial streaming or transitions.
Expand on Error Recovery

Clarify patch-based or skip-based approaches for chunk-level validation errors.
Provide robust instructions for checkpointing to facilitate re-sends on transient errors.
Detail SSE & CORS

Expand on best practices for SSE (Content-Type, CORS headers, auto-reconnect logic).
Add mention of typical SSE fallback or backoff strategies.
Include Flow Control

Summarize small window-based flow control to handle backpressure or slower connections.
Keep Existing Structure

Insert bulletproof solutions under a “Bulletproof Approach” heading in the existing file.
Retain all original text.
Implementation Plan
Add a new heading in nextup.md named “Bulletproof Approach.”
Include the buffering, rolling schema version, error recovery, SSE/CORS, and flow control expansions.
Preserve original headings, code blocks, and references intact.
Confirm no string literals or logic is removed; only clarifications added.
Verification Steps
Check Markdowns: Confirm nextup.md still includes all original sections.
Ensure each newly added bullet or heading does not remove or alter existing text.
Validate references to code or diagrams remain intact.
Review final file for correct structure, with no broken headings or removed content.
Confirm no changes to actual code or environment variables were made, maintaining the original functionality.
