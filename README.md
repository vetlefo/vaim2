# Project Roadmap Components

This repository contains the modular components of the comprehensive project roadmap. The roadmap has been broken down into smaller, manageable sections organized into the following directories:

## Main Sections

1. **Phases** - Contains detailed breakdown of each implementation phase
   - [Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundations](phases/phase1.md)
   - [Phase 2: Core Service Implementation](phases/phase2.md)
   - [Phase 3: Data Integration Layer](phases/phase3.md)
   - [Phase 4: User Interface Development](phases/phase4.md)
   - [Phase 5: Security Implementation](phases/phase5.md)
   - [Phase 6: Performance Optimization](phases/phase6.md)
   - [Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance](phases/phase7.md)
   - [Phase 8: Deployment Strategy](phases/phase8.md)
   - [Phase 9: Monitoring & Maintenance](phases/phase9.md)
   - [Phase 10: Documentation & Training](phases/phase10.md)
2. **Tools** - Documentation for each tool and its usage in the project
3. **Workflows** - High-level workflows and integration patterns
4. **Implementation** - Detailed implementation roadmap and timelines

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── phases/          # Detailed phase documentation
├── tools/           # Tool-specific documentation
├── workflows/       # Workflow diagrams and descriptions
├── implementation/  # Implementation timeline and milestones
└── README.md        # Main overview document
```

## How to Use

1. Start with the README.md for an overview
2. Explore specific phases in the phases/ directory
3. Refer to tools/ for tool-specific guidance
4. Check workflows/ for integration patterns
5. Review implementation/ for timeline details
