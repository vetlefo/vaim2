# VAIM2 - Advanced AI Integration Platform

A comprehensive microservices platform for integrating and managing AI services with advanced graph analytics capabilities.

## Project Overview

VAIM2 is a scalable, secure platform built on modern microservices architecture, designed to:
- Provide unified access to multiple LLM providers
- Enable sophisticated graph-based analytics
- Ensure secure authentication and authorization
- Support high-performance computing integration
- Maintain quantum-readiness for future capabilities

## Architecture

### Core Services

1. **Auth Service**
   - OAuth2 authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - JWT token management
   - [Documentation](services/auth-service/README.md)

2. **Graph Analytics Service**
   - Neo4j-based graph processing
   - Real-time analytics pipeline
   - Data transformation workflows
   - [Documentation](services/graph-analytics-service/README.md)

3. **LLM Service**
   - Multi-provider LLM integration
   - Response streaming
   - Rate limiting and caching
   - [Documentation](services/llm-service/README.md)

### Key Features

- Microservices architecture with Docker containerization
